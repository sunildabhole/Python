# 1. Create a class (2-D vector) and use it to create another Class representing a 3-D vector.
# 2. Create a class 'Pets' from a class 'Animals' and further create class 'Dog' from 'Pets'. Add a method 'bark' to class 'Dog'.
# 3. Create a class 'Employee' and add salary and increment properties to it.

# 4. Write a class 'Complex' to represent complex numbers, along with overloaded operators '+' and '*' which adds and multiplies them.
# 5. + Write a class vector representing a vector of n dimensions. Overload the + and * operator which Calculates the sum and the dot(.) product of them.
# 6. Write __str__() method to print the vector as follows:
            7i+8j+10k
    Assume vector of dimension 3 for this problem.
# 7. Override the __len__() methon on vector of problem 5 to display the dimension of the Vector.
